# multibox

This is an implementation of the Multibox detection system proposed by Szegedy et al. in [Scalable High Quality Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1441). Currently this repository uses the [Inception-Reset-v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261) network as the base network. The post classification network is not currently incorporated in this repository, but any classification network can be used. 

I use the master branch of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
